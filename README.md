# FortniteMappingsJWP
Fortnite Mappings for the [JohnWickParse](https://github.com/SirWaddles/JohnWickParse) library.

These mappings are also compatible with the nodeJS version, [node-wick](https://github.com/SirWaddles/node-wick).

All mappings in this repositry are based off the FModel [FortniteTypeMappings](https://github.com/FabianFG/FortniteTypeMappings) and are parsed automatically using a custom tool, to work with JWP.

**Notice: not all, but a vast majority of the FModel mappings are supported by the parser used to generate these mappings. Contact me on discord if you want me to check anything manually: VastBlast#5771**
